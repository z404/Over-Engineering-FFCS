<h3>Welcome to Over Engineering FFCS</h3>
<h5>&nbsp; &nbsp;What is OEFFCS?</h5>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This project helps a user go thorugh the process of planning and executing their ideal FFCS timetable.
<h5>&nbsp; &nbsp;How do I use it and how can it help me?</h5>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You start this sequence off by uploading an excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet will be given to you by
VIT. This excel sheet must have certain important columns which are vital to the running of this project. Once the excel sheet is
uploaded, you can now select your preferred teachers from all the subjects you want to get in your timetables. Wait while the program generates all the timetables.
Once this is done, you can add filters to reduce the number of timetables you don't want. You can then go through the remaining timetables
and give them the required priority. Once you have finally chosen a great timetable, you can generate a teacher list and WIN FFCS!
<h5>Warnings you might want to read</h5>
<ul><li>
This is an experimental project. Do not try to break the program with weird inputs. We might have to delete accounts
</li>
<li>
Try not to select too many teachers just because you can. This is a very process intensive task. It slows down other's usage of the program and will block your account until it is completed. Recommended amount is 5-6 teachers per subject (10 minutes wait time)
</li>
<li>
This project was made over the course of 4 and a half months with a lot of time spent, and over 5,000 lines of code. We would like to emphasize the policy of not sharing the idea and the existence of this project or the teacher list given by this project to anyone outside of those allowed to use this project.
</li>
</ul>
